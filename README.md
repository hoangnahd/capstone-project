# Airdrop Smart Contract

This project implements an **upgradable airdrop smart contract** on Ethereum-compatible networks using **Hardhat**.  
It uses a **Merkle Tree-based whitelist** for secure token distribution and includes scripts for building, deploying, and testing the contract.

## Scripts Overview

### `scripts/merkleTree/`
- **buildTree.ts** ‚Äì Builds the Merkle Tree from whitelist addresses.  
- **generateWhitelist.ts** ‚Äì Generates a JSON whitelist of eligible addresses.  
- **whitelist.json** ‚Äì Contains whitelisted addresses for the airdrop.

### Other Scripts
- **test_airdrop.ts** ‚Äì Tests the airdrop contract using generated Merkle proofs.

## Features

- **Upgradable Airdrop Contract** ‚Äî Uses OpenZeppelin Upgradeable Contracts.
- **Merkle Tree Whitelist** ‚Äî Efficient and private eligibility verification.
- **Token Minting** ‚Äî Distributes ERC20 tokens via the airdrop.
- **Automated Deployment** ‚Äî Hardhat deploy scripts for quick setup.
- **Comprehensive Testing** ‚Äî Validate airdrop logic and Merkle proofs.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <repo-folder>
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
3. **Create a .env file**
   ```bash
   TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY=<your-private-key>
   RPC_URL=<your-rpc-endpoint>
   
## Deployment

Deploy the upgradable airdrop contract:

  ```bash
  npx hardhat deploy
  ```
## Testing the Airdrop

Navigate to the scripts folder and run the test script:
  ```bash
  cd scripts
  npx ts-node test_airdrop.ts
  ```

This will:

  Use whitelist.json and generated Merkle proofs

  Simulate claiming tokens through the Airdrop contract

  Verify Merkle proof validation and token minting

## Output

  The output/ folder contains:
  
  Merkle Root ‚Äî Stored on-chain during deployment
  
  Proofs ‚Äî Generated proofs for each whitelisted address
  
  These files are used in the test_airdrop.ts script for verification.

## Notes

  Ensure the whitelist.json file is generated before running deployment or test scripts.
  
  The contract is upgradable, allowing future upgrades without redeploying from scratch.
  
  Supports Sepolia or any other EVM-compatible testnet/mainnet.
